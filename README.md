# Fedora Social hour Skribbl.io

https://skribbl.io is:

> a free multiplayer drawing and guessing game.

It supports using a custom dictionary, so this is one I threw together for Fedora

## Rules/guidlines

- Words and concepts should not be culture specific
- Fedora, Linux, and Open source related words are encouraged
- Words should be family freindly 
- Words can be no longer than 30 characters
- Words can have spaces
- All words should be seperated by commas

### Example 

> Word1, Word 2, Word three, word

## Using

When starting a private game, there is a box to input custom words. 
Copy and paste words.txt into the box. 
Selecting to only use custom words is up you, however, due to the massive amount of words in english, it's uncommon for you to get a custom word, without turning on the option to use only custom words.
